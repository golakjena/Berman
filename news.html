			<h4>"Brexit" and the Financial Markets</h4>
			<h5>June 2016</h5>
			<p>Markets have fallen sharply over the past week as investors have begun to worry about “Brexit” in earnest. Brexit (the amalgamation of British + Exit) refers to the possibility that U.K. citizens may vote to leave the Eurozone in an upcoming referendum. The referendum is actually not legally binding upon Parliament. However, it would create great uncertainty and throw European politics into turmoil.</p>

			<h4>Energy and MLP Turmoil – Follow-Up</h4>
			<h5>December 2015</h5>
			<p>2015 has been the annus horribilis for MLP investors, with the principal Alerian MLP Index down just over 40% through November. Price drops like this certainly prompt a reassessment of the thesis – is the market in an unjustified panic, or did our analysis take a very wrong turn? Compared to the recent past, fundamentals have turned more negative for MLPs – yet we believe the market reaction is far in excess of the facts on the ground.</p>

			<h4>Update on MLP Investments</h4>
			<h5>October 2015</h5>
			<p>In August, we wrote to you about falling oil prices and the consequent impact on MLPs / energy infrastructure. Since the time of our writing, oil has remained quite volatile but is actually about flat point to point. MLPs, on the other hand, have lately come under even more pressure, falling over 8% September 28-29 alone. Given that MLPs are generally considered safer than their associated commodities, investors want to know, "what is going on?"</p>

			<h4>Recent Oil Market Tumult and MLP Investments</h4>
			<h5>August 2015</h5>
			<p>Oil prices have taken investors on a wild and unpleasant ride as of late. Since last August, WTI (West Texas Intermediate) Oil has dropped by just over 50% as of the time of this writing. The initial round of selling took place in the second half of 2014, rebounded significantly, only to collapse again. Oil has now retraced to the old January lows below $45 a barrel.</p>

			<h4>Berman Capital Advisors Q2 2015 Review</h4>
			<h5>July 2015</h5>
			<p>As the second quarter began, investors worried about an apparent slowdown in the U.S. economy. However, it turns out the soft growth data was the result of bad weather, a port strike and a negative seasonal adjustment which was later reversed.</p>
            <p>Despite the continuation of higher volatility that was experienced in 2013 and 2014, stocks have managed to stay in positive territory for the year. Equities have been aided by mildly improving economic data, continued easy monetary policy from global central banks, and high levels of merger and acquisition (M&A) activity. The S&P 500 has gone 914 days without a 10% correction, its third-longest run on record. European stocks have been able to push past renewed worries over Greece on the back of low valuations, improving data, and belief that the worst case scenario of a “Grexit” wouldn’t result in financial contagion.</p>
            <p>Bond investors fared worse, with the Barclays Capital Long-Term Treasury Index dropping 4.7%. 2015 represents the first year in almost a hundred in which both the Dow Jones Industrials and long-term Treasuries fell during the first six months of a pre-election year (typically they are quite strong).</p>

			<h4>Recent Market Turmoil</h4>
			<h5>July 2015</h5>
			<p>Markets have been volatile the past couple of weeks as worries regarding Greece’s potential exit from the Eurozone and a bursting bubble in China’s stock market have come to the fore. After starting the second quarter in positive territory, the major indexes have all turned lower. The U.S., partly due to its status as a safer haven without an immediate negative catalyst, is only down 0.75% as of July 8th. Europe is lower by almost 3% (in USD), and the more volatile emerging markets are lower by almost 7%. These worries have been worsened by the trading halt the NYSE endured Wednesday. Let’s take each of these events in turn.</p>

			<h4>The Greek Endgame</h4>
			<h5>July 2015</h5>
			<p>Global markets are in turmoil today as the long-running Greek financial crisis is finally coming to a head. Despite the recent turmoil, for investors the negative impact of this seemingly never-ending crisis will likely be limited. Crucially, and unlike the 2011 crisis, Europe has likely done enough to prevent a broader financial contagion if there is a default. Contagion has always been the real issue, as Greece itself is a tiny part of the global economy.</p>

			<h4>Berman Capital Advisors Q1 2015 Review</h4>
			<h5>April 2015</h5>
			<p>As expected, volatility picked up in the equity markets in Q1. This increases the odds that hedged managers have a better relative performance in 2015. However, we still see equity exposure as favored overall. International developed markets such as Europe and Japan performed well in the quarter, and we are actively exploring increasing exposure to those markets which have lagged far behind the U.S. recovery. As we noted last quarter, while Europe and Japan are suffering from weak economies, we think their shared commitment to tackle deflation is a very significant positive.</p>
            <p>Global growth remains slow and inflation is tightly controlled, so we stick by our stance that bonds will perform adequately in 2015, but beyond that, returns for interest-rate sensitive investments will likely be poor. We continue to see opportunities in niche credit opportunities where large banks have retrenched, leaving borrowers looking for an alternative.</p>

			<p>Dear Clients: In an effort to assist in the fight against cybercrime, and keep your private information safe, we want to share some interesting information with you.</p>
            <p>Many sites, including Gmail, were exposed to a bug called "Heartbleed". The Heartbleed bug allows information leaks from a key safety feature that is typically known to keep your online communication private when emailing, banking, shopping etc. As an example, one of our partners received an email from an impersonator of American Express with a hyperlink to a malware site.</p>
            <p>Please be on high alert of suspicious emails from any source. It has also been advised that we all change passwords to sites listed in the CNN story in the link found below. Please do not change passwords to any sites that have not been cleared, or your new password will also be compromised. It is generally advised that passwords be at least nine characters and that they include a mix of upper- and lower-case letters and numbers.</p>
            <p>We are happy to say that the "client login" link from www.bermancapital.com was not compromised, nor were the sites of our most common client custodians, Pershing and Schwab.</p>
