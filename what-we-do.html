					<h4>Planning</h4>
					<p>At Berman Capital Advisors, we work closely with each individual and family—as well as with their tax and estate planning professionals—to build and implement a tailored investment and asset allocation plan that reflects the client's goals and preferences. We focus on after-tax returns and tax-efficient investing and philanthropy.</p>
					<h4>Portfolio Construction</h4>
					<p>Berman Capital Advisors specializes in constructing individual, customized portfolios. Our investment philosophy focuses on absolute risk-adjusted returns and protection of capital by looking at the entire universe of investible assets – from private equity and venture capital to individual stocks and mutual funds – and finding only the best ones for our clients. We do not accept commissions and work on a fee-basis only.</p>
					<h4>Research</h4>
					<p>Our rigorous evaluation process emphasizes overall performance, risk management, and absolute returns. This process utilizes both proprietary quantitative models to analyze a manager's risk/return characteristics and a rigorous evaluation of the fund, its team, structure, etc. We perform on-site visits and interviews to really get to know how a manager thinks and acts. A dedicated team conducts continuous due diligence on all managers. Ultimately we look for experienced managers that can deliver outstanding risk-adjusted returns. Our research is at the core of our portfolio construction process, and is one of the features that makes BCA so unique.</p>

					<h4>Estate &amp; Trust Planning</h4>
					<p>Our ongoing support includes asset-transfers, working with counsel and fiduciaries, and assisting with the education and mentoring of beneficiaries.</p>
					<h4>Tax Planning</h4>
					<p>As part of our portfolio review, we examine tax obligations and make recommendations on ways to reduce the impact of tax consequences. We also work with accountants and others to identify local and state tax credits, and coordinate delivery of documents.</p>
					<h4>Income/Debt Analysis, Reporting &amp; Projections</h4>
					<p>On an ongoing basis, we provide cash-flow budgeting and monitoring, with customized financial statements showing expected income, obligations, margin requirements, expenses and more. Statements are generated every month, with more detailed statements every quarter.</p>
                    <h4>Risk Management</h4>
					<p>No financial portfolio is complete without a comprehensive risk management plan. We advise on life and other insurance offerings, coordinate policy management and facilitate renewals.</p>
